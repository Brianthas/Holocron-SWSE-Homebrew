# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Project scaffold: TypeScript, Vite build, fvtt-types, migration runner, CI.
- Snapshots of the Episode VII house rules, level-up guide, species rarity and droids pages in
  `docs/rules/`.
- Rulings that clarify the snapshots in `docs/rulings.md`.
- F1 vertical slice: character data model (abilities, species +2 choice, Defense points, trained
  skills), item models for species, class, feat and weapon, and derived ability scores, level,
  base attack bonus, Defenses and skills as labelled breakdowns. Size sets a species' fixed
  ability adjustments and the Reflex size modifier.
- A "bonus" Active Effect change type and a "derived" phase: a bonus is a labelled term in a
  breakdown, not a written value. Bonuses of one type do not stack; untyped bonuses do.
- Ranged attack (base attack bonus + DEX against each target's Reflex) and damage (weapon dice +
  DEX + half heroic level) posted to chat.
- A throwaway debug sheet showing each total with its breakdown as a tooltip, until the signed-off
  sheet is built.
- Effects: changes carry a bonus type and a condition. A conditional bonus is listed with its total
  and never added to it. "grant" changes give weapon or armor proficiency or a trained skill;
  "dice" changes add damage dice of the weapon's size. A bonus key must be one of a closed set of
  selectors (defense, skill, attack and damage by category or weapon group, and a few more); a key
  outside it is reported in the console and ignored.
- Melee attacks use STR until the per-weapon ability choice exists; ranged attacks use DEX.
- Weapon groups follow the house weapon tables: Simple, Advanced Melee, Lightsabers, Pistols,
  Rifles and Heavy Weapons. The Bow and the Grenade are Simple.
